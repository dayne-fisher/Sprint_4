# Title: What affects the number of days a car is listed on the market?
# In this project, we will look at data about vehicles in the US and see the number of days by each vehicle they are listed and analyze what variables affect the amount the most. We can then presnt this information and use it to help which vehicles should be focused on more for advertising to sell.

# To complete this project, you will have to import the standard packages to start to run the data. 
# Those would be pandas, numpy, plotly.express and streamlit. 
# After running this code, we need to read the data set itself. The data is about the Ads by each vehicle in the US. 
# Once the data has been uploaded, we create a selectbox to show data filtered by each model in the data.
# We then run a code to create a histogram and scatterplot to show how varialbes affect the number of days a vehicle is posted for.
# After creating these graphs, we can analyze which variables affect the data the most and come up with a solution to help lower the days a vehicles is posted and get it to sell.
